# CS460-NISER-Fall-Semester-2021-22
This is a repository in which I shall store my submissions to assignments, and maybe more, for the course CS460 - Machine Learning, that is currently being taught by Dr. Subhankar Mishra, School of Computer Sciences, NISER Bhubaneswar.

**N.B.** Please do not copy my code and represent it as your work, por favor; feel free to refer to my work as long as it is not in violation of the course's ethical code. Give credit where it's due, and inform me if you want to use any part of my code with a valid reason.
